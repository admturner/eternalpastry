instructions:
  - section: 'Make the poolish preferment'
    steps:
      - Combine the 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flout, 1/4 teaspoon of yeast, and 1 cup of water in a medium bowl by hand or with a wooden spoon. Try to get all of the lumps out. [TODO Note this should have equal water and flour by weight.]
      - Let it ferment in the refrigerator overnight or up to 24 hours.
  - section: 'Prepare the dough'
    steps:
      - Remove the preferment from the fridge and stir in the additional 1 teaspoon yeast, 1/4 cup malt extract, 6 1/2 cups flour, and 1 tablespoon of salt.
      - Turn out the dough and knead for about 10 minutes until it's firm and elastic. It'll be a little sticky at first. I recommend using a little water on your hands if it sticks too much.
      - Place the dough in a lightly oiled container, cover, and let rise in a draft-free place for 1 to 2 hours, or until doubled in bulk.
  - section: 'Shape the bagels'
    steps:
      - Lightly oil two large baking sheets.
      - Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Shape each into tight balls and place on the prepared baking sheets. Lightly cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
      - Gently flatten each ball with the palm of your hand into a thick disk.
      - Form a hole in each using your thumb to press through the center of the disk to the baking sheet below and gently widen the hole.
      - Your goal is to create 12 dough rings with holes about 1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter. The holes need to be bigger than you'd want in the finished bagel to account for the expanding dough during rising and cooking.
      - Lightly cover -- with plastic wrap or cloth -- and let rise for 25-25 minutes or until almost doubled in bulk.
  - section: 'Boil and bake'
    steps:
      - Preheat the oven to 400&deg; F.
      - Fill a large pot -- big enough for two or three bagels to fit without crowding each other, about 2 quarts -- with cold water. Stir in 1 tablespoon of baking soda and bring to a high simmer; just under a full boil.
      - Prepare a baking sheet or some counter space with cloth or paper towels to dry the boiled bagels on.
      - Boil two or three bagels at a time (transfer them gently to avoid knocking out the air) for 1 minute then flip and one more minute.
      - Remove the boiled bagels to the prepared towel to dry. Now is the time to sprinkle them with toppings if you're not using an egg wash.
      - Continue the process until you've boiled all 12.
      - Transfer the boiled bagels to baking sheets (use parchment paper lining for best results).
      - Bake for 25-30 minutes until they're a deep golden color. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
