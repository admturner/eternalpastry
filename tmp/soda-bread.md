    amount: 250 grams

instructions:
  - section: Prepare the dough.
    steps:
      - Preheat your oven to 400&deg; F.
      - Mix the dry ingredients -- the flours, baking soda, and salt -- in a large bowl.
      - Make sure the oven is heated before adding the buttermilk to the dry mixture. As soon as the acids in the buttermilk meet the baking soda they'll start reacting, so you'll want to get it in the heated oven as quickly as possible (don't stress, it's not an emergency).
      - Add the buttermilk and mix just until a dough forms. It's supposed to be sticky. Don't worry if it seems overly wet.
      - Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently fold it a few times to bring it together. You don't want to knead this. Just work it enough so it holds together.
      - If you want a single loaf, shape it into a ball and gently flatten it with your hand. Deeply score the dough with a sharp knife. Cut all the way through so that it's divided into quarters, but don't separate them. If you want rolls or small loaves, divide the dough into four equal pieces and gently roll each into the desired shape.
      - Lightly dust the bread with flour and place onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 30 minutes if making a single loaf, or 20-25 minutes if making four smaller loaves. The finished loaf should be golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.
      - Cool on a wire rack.
