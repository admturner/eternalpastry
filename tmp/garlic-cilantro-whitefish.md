  - section: 'Prepare the fish'
    steps:
      - Combine the garlic, cilantro, lime, cumin, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl and mix well. (You could also do this in a food processor, but don't puree it.)
      - Gradually add the tequila while stirring constantly.
      - Marinate the fish fillets in the garlic-cilantro mixture. I generally use a high-sided pan like a casserole dish. (You could also marinate them in a 1-gallon resealable bag). Set aside at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes.
      - Heat an electric or cast iron griddle to 375&deg; F. and add the oil.
      - Cook the fillets until just cooked through and opaque, probably 3 to 4 minutes per side.
      - Remove from the heat and let rest for a few minutes before serving.
