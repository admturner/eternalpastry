    steps:
      - Melt the butter with the oil over medium heat in a medium saucier (or any other pan with high sides you have a lid for).
      - When the butter is hot, fry the cardamom, fenugreek, and nigella until fragrant -- about 1-2 minutes.
      - Add the onions, ginger, chili, and chard stems. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned (about 10 minutes).
      - Add the garlic and stir constantly for 30-60 seconds or until fragrant.
      - Add the chard and the water, salt, and pepper. Cover and bring just to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cover. Cook until the greens are wilted and tender, stirring once or twice during the duration, for about 20-25 minutes.
      - Add the lemon juice to taste and serve hot.

## Variations

- You can replace the spices with 2 teaspoons of berbere for a similar, but more paprika-centered flavor.

- Use collard greens instead of chard if you want to hew a little closer to the standard recipe. If you do, you may not want to add the stems. You'll also need to increase the water to 1 1/3 cups and increase the cooking time to 50-55 minutes.
