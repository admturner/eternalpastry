    amount: 1 tablespoon
  - type: fresh ginger

instructions:
  - section: Make the rice.
    steps:
      - Heat about 1 teaspoon of the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
      - Add the ginger and cook, stirring frequently, until it starts to soften (about five minutes). While it cooks you can rinse the rice.
      - Add the rice to the ginger and cook for a minute or two, stirring constantly, then add the water. Follow the instructions for the rice you're using to determine how much water to use (for 1 cup of dry medium grain brown rice, probably about 1 1/3 cup).
      - Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce to low and simmer, covered, until the water is absorbed -- about 30-40 minutes. Remove from heat and let rest, covered, for 5-10 minutes when done.
      - While the rice is cooking you can prep the bell pepper mixture. Start by heating the rest of the oil (about 2 teaspoons) over medium-high heat in a medium skillet.
      - Stir-fry the onion and bell pepper until both begin to soften (about 5 minutes) then reduce heat to medium and add the salt. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are translucent, probably another 5-10 minutes.
      - Stir in the peas and remove from heat. Continue cooking for a few minutes if using frozen peas to given them time to thaw. If they're already room temperature you can stir them in and remove the bell pepper mixture from the heat immediately.
      - Add the bell pepper mixture to the cooked rice and serve.
