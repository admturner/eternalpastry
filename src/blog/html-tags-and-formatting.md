## Blockquotes

Single line blockquote:

Multi line blockquote with a cite reference:  

<blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or <em>HTML Block Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/blockquote#Notes">Notes</a> for how to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the <strong>cite</strong> attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the <a title="The HTML Citation Element &lt;cite&gt; represents a reference to a creative work. It must include the title of a work or a URL reference, which may be in an abbreviated form according to the conventions used for the addition of citation metadata." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite"><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code></a> element.</blockquote>

## HTML Tags

These supported tags come from the WordPress.com code [FAQ](https://en.support.wordpress.com/code/).

### Address Tag

<address>1 Infinite Loop  
Cupertino, CA 95014  
United States</address>

### Anchor Tag (aka. Link)

This is an <a href="https://wordpressfoundation.org/">example of a link</a>.

### Abbreviation Tag

The abbreviation <abbr title="Seriously">srsly</abbr> stands for "seriously".

### Cite Tag

"Code is poetry." --<cite>Automattic</cite>

### Code Tag

This tag styles blocks of code.

```css
.post-title {
  margin: 0 0 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 38px;
  line-height: 1.2;

  /* and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how it is handled and to find out how it overflows */
}
```

You will learn later on in these tests that `word-wrap: break-word;` will be your best friend.

### Delete Tag

This ~~tag will let~~ you <del cite="deleted it">strike out text</del>, but this tag is <em>recommended</em> supported in HTML5 (use the `<s>` instead).

### Emphasize Tag

The emphasize tag should *italicize this* text.

### Horizontal Rule Tag

---

This sentence is following a `<hr>` tag.

### Insert Tag

This tag should denote <ins cite="inserted it">inserted</ins> text.

### Keyboard Tag

This scarcely known tag emulates <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which is usually styled like the `<code>` tag.

### Preformatted Tag

This tag is for preserving whitespace as typed, such as in poetry or ASCII art.

**The Road Not Taken**

<pre>
  <cite>Robert Frost</cite>

  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
  And sorry I could not travel both
  And be one traveler, long I stood
  And looked down one as far as I could
  To where it bent in the undergrowth;

  Then took the other, as just as fair,
  And having perhaps the better claim,
  Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
  Though as for that the passing there
  Had worn them really about the same,

  And both that morning equally lay
  In leaves no step had trodden black.
  Oh, I kept the first for another day!
  Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
  I doubted if I should ever come back.

  I shall be telling this with a sigh
  Somewhere ages and ages hence:
  Two roads diverged in a wood, and I‚Äî
  I took the one less traveled by,
  And that has made all the difference.

  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how it is handled and to find out how it overflows;
</pre>

### Quote Tag for short, inline quotes

<q>Developers, developers, developers...</q> --Steve Ballmer

### Small Tag

This tag shows <small>smaller</small> text.

### Strong Tag

This tag shows **bold text**.

### Subscript Tag

Getting our science styling on with H<sub>2</sub>O, which should push the "2" down.

### Superscript Tag

Still sticking with science and Albert Einstein's E = MC<sup>2</sup>, which should lift the 2 up.

### Underline Tag (*deprecated in HTML 4, re-introduced in HTML5 with other semantics*)

This tag shows <u>underlined text</u>.

### Variable Tag

This allows you to denote <var>variables</var>.
