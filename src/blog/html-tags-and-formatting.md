## Blockquotes

Single line blockquote:

Multi line blockquote with a cite reference:

<blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or <em>HTML Block Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/blockquote#Notes">Notes</a> for how to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the <strong>cite</strong> attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the <a title="The HTML Citation Element &lt;cite&gt; represents a reference to a creative work. It must include the title of a work or a URL reference, which may be in an abbreviated form according to the conventions used for the addition of citation metadata." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite"><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code></a> element.</blockquote>

## HTML Tags

	margin: 0 0 5px;<br />
	font-weight: bold;<br />
	font-size: 38px;<br />
	line-height: 1.2;<br />
	and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how it is handled and to find out how it overflows;<br />
}</code><br />You will learn later on in these tests that word-wrap: break-word;will be your best friend.

<strong>Delete Tag</strong>

This tag will let you <del cite="deleted it">strike out text</del>, but this tag is <em>recommended</em> supported in HTML5 (use the <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> instead).

<strong>Preformatted Tag</strong>

This tag is for preserving whitespace as typed, such as in poetry or ASCII art.

## The Road Not Taken

<pre><cite>Robert Frost</cite>


  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
  And sorry I could not travel both
  And be one traveler, long I stood
  And looked down one as far as I could
  To where it bent in the undergrowth;

  Then took the other, as just as fair,
  And having perhaps the better claim,
  Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
  Though as for that the passing there
  Had worn them really about the same,

  And both that morning equally lay
  In leaves no step had trodden black.
  Oh, I kept the first for another day!
  Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
  I doubted if I should ever come back.

  I shall be telling this with a sigh
  Somewhere ages and ages hence:
  Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
  I took the one less traveled by,
  And that has made all the difference.

  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how it is handled and to find out how it overflows;
</pre>
